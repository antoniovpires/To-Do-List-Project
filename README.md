# To Do List 
 This is a To Do List project developed during Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 🧙‍♀️

 ✍🏼 I've had a great experience with this project! Not only I have improved my HTML and CSS knowledge but I have also learned new hard skills such as: EJS and NodeJS. 👓
 <br>
 <br>
 ⌚️ At first I thought EJS was pretty difficult, mainly because of it's syntax. But then I realized how awesome it was! Being able to use the same header and footer in multiple pages, and also generating new routes in your website through the "post" method.

 🔧 I'm very glad that I didn't skip any HTML, CSS nor JavaScript lesson and now I have a strong understandment about the core of all these technologies. I feel ready to face all these frameworks and use them consistently. 👨🏻‍💻
